abstract = {The Voronoi tessellation is a fundamental geometric data structure which has numerous applications in various scientific and technological fields. For large particle datasets, computing Voronoi tessellations must be conducted in parallel on a distributed-memory supercomputer in order to satisfy time and memory-size constraints. However, due to load balance and communication, the parallelization of the Voronoi tessellation renders a challenge. In this paper, we present a scalable parallel algorithm for constructing 3D Voronoi tessellations, which evenly distributes the input particles between blocks through kd-tree decomposition. In order to construct the correct global Voronoi topology, we investigate both parametric and non-parametric methods for particle communication among the blocks of a spatial decomposition. The algorithm is implemented exploiting process-level and thread-level parallelization and can be used in a diverse architectural landscape. Using datasets containing up to 330 million particles, we show that our algorithm achieves parallel efficiency up to 57% using 4096 cores on a distributed-memory computer. Moreover, we compare our algorithm with previous attempts to parallelize Voronoi tessellations showing encouraging improvements in terms of computation time.}

abstract="This paper introduces a new method for anisotropic surface meshing. From an input polygonal mesh and a specified number of vertices, the method generates a curvature-adapted mesh. The main idea consists in transforming the 3d anisotropic space into a higher dimensional isotropic space (typically 6d or larger). In this high dimensional space, the mesh is optimized by computing a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), i.e. the minimizer of a C2 objective function that depends on the coordinates at the vertices (quantization noise power). Optimizing this objective function requires to compute the intersection between the (higher dimensional) Voronoi cells and the surface (Restricted Voronoi Diagram). The method overcomes the d-factorial cost of computing a Voronoi diagram of dimension d by directly computing the restricted Voronoi cells with a new algorithm that can be easily parallelized (Vorpaline: Voronoi Parallel Linear Enumeration). The method is demonstrated with several examples comprising CAD and scanned meshes.",

abstract = {Summary This paper presents a new scalable parallelization scheme to generate the 3D Delaunay triangulation of a given set of points. Our first contribution is an efficient serial implementation of the incremental Delaunay insertion algorithm. A simple dedicated data structure, an efficient sorting of the points, and the optimization of the insertion algorithm have permitted to accelerate reference implementations by a factor three. Our second contribution is a multithreaded version of the Delaunay kernel that is able to concurrently insert vertices. Moore curve coordinates are used to partition the point set, avoiding heavy synchronization overheads. Conflicts are managed by modifying the partitions with a simple rescaling of the space-filling curve. The performances of our implementation have been measured on three different processors: an Intel core-i7, an Intel Xeon Phi, and an AMD EPYC, on which we have been able to compute three billion tetrahedra in 53 seconds. This corresponds to a generation rate of over 55 million tetrahedra per second. We finally show how this very efficient parallel Delaunay triangulation can be integrated in a Delaunay refinement mesh generator, which takes as input the triangulated surface boundary of the volume to mesh.},

    abstract = {We leverage powerful mathematical tools stemming from optimal transport theory and transform them into an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the fluctuations of the primordial density field, built on solving the Monge-Ampère-Kantorovich equation. Our algorithm computes the optimal transport between an initial uniform continuous density field, partitioned into Laguerre cells, and a final input set of discrete point masses, linking the early to the late Universe. While existing early universe reconstruction algorithms based on fully discrete combinatorial methods are limited to a few hundred thousand points, our algorithm scales up well beyond this limit, since it takes the form of a well-posed smooth convex optimization problem, solved using a Newton method. We run our algorithm on cosmological N-body simulations, from the AbacusCosmos suite, and reconstruct the initial positions of \$\\mathcal \{O\}(10^7)\$ particles within a few hours with an off-the-shelf personal computer. We show that our method allows a unique, fast, and precise recovery of subtle features of the initial power spectrum, such as the baryonic acoustic oscillations.},
